# ai_lab_pacman_pathfind_algorithms

University Lab for the "AI Basics" subject.
The goal is to achieve automatic search of the candy by the PacMan using different algorithms.
Algorithms implemented:
  - DFS;
  - BFS;
  - to be continued in the next lab...

The core code of the game was taken from https://github.com/janbodnar/Java-Pacman-Game

For teacher: 
  This lab (DFS + BFS) was made by:
  - Ihor Paprotskyi: creating additional classes and relations structure, implementing BFS, time measurement, pacman walking by the automatic "keys" Thread;
  
  - Oleksii Lozovoi: changing map and Board, generating random candy, implementing DFS, steps measurement, pacman walking by the automatic "keys" Thread.
